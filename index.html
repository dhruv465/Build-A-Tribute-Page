            Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco,
            California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew up with
            one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a
            hobby.

            After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs attended Reed
            College in Portland, Oregon, for two years. He dropped out after one
            semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of
            1974.

            In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One
            member, a technical whiz named Steve Wozniak, was trying to build a
            computer. Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew
            Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development
            and marketing of the first Apple computer.

            In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it
            Apple Computer Company, in memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent
            picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling
            Jobs's microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit
            boards (the boards that hold the internal components of a computer)
            while they worked on the computer prototype (sample).

            In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.
            The on-screen display had small pictures called icons. To use the
            computer, the user pointed at an icon and clicked a button using a
            new device called a mouse. This process made the Macintosh very easy
            to use. The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses, however. It
            lacked features other personal computers had, such as a
            corresponding high quality printer.

            The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's
            downfall at Apple. Jobs resigned in 1985 from the company he had
            helped found, though he retained his title as chairman of its board
            of directors.

            Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer
            company called NeXT. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced
            at a large gala event in San Francisco, aimed at the educational
            market. Initial reactions were generally good. The product was very
            user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics
            displays, and an outstanding sound system. Despite the warm
            reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too
            costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to
            other computers or run common software.

            NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased
            a small company called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–).
            Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine years later Pixar
            released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to
            make Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, which Disney distributed, and
            Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely successful.
            Monsters, Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any
            animated film in history.

            In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs said, "The thing that
            drives me and my colleagues … is that you see something very
            compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to get it, but you
            know, sometimes intuitively, it's within your grasp. And it's worth
            putting in years of your life to make it come into existence." Jobs
            has worked hard to translate his ideas into exciting and innovative
            products for businesses and consumers. He was instrumental in
            launching the age of the personal computer. Steve Jobs is truly a
            computer industry visionary. <br />In December of 1996 Apple
            purchased NeXT Software for over $400 million. Jobs returned to
            Apple as a part-time consultant to the chief executive officer
            (CEO). The following year, in a surprising event, Apple entered into
            a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two companies,
            according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on several
            sales and technology fronts." Over the next six years Apple
            introduced several new products and marketing strategies.

            In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly
            to users over the Internet and by telephone. The Apple Store became
            a runaway success. Within a week it was the third-largest e-commerce
            site on the Internet. In September of 1997 Jobs was named interim
            CEO of Apple.<br />
            In 1998 Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured
            powerful computing at an affordable price. The iBook was unveiled in
            July 1999. This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright
            colors. It includes Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the
            cordless phone that would allow the user to surf the Internet
            wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs unveiled Apple's new Internet
            strategy. It included a group of Macintosh-only Internet-based
            applications. Jobs also announced that he was becoming the permanent
            CEO of Apple.

            Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first iPhone in
            2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone
            created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten
            Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of
            the Year" for 2007.

            Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on
            October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his
            previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,which
            resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost consciousness the day
            before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.
            His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final
            words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.
            Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long
            time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then
            over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow.
            Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours
            later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the
            details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made
            public.

            >I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and
            idealistic industry. There weren't many degrees offered in computer
            science, so people in computers were brilliant people from
            mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and
            no one was really in it for the money... There are people around
            here who start companies just to make money, but the great
            companies, well, that's not what they're about."</i
